Welcome to nhSkript!

This is the main repo where we shall post all of our code. We have a lot of projects and we're not even fully started. Our main development project is ShopSearch, followed by PayPoint. We're trying to break the laws of Skript by bring new and exiciting features to everyone. 

All of our scripts are made to the highest standards and are rigously tested before public release. However, code in thie repo on unreleased projects or code in the Pre-Release branch may not have been tested. We will never overwrite a release script, but instead create a new version of it. This means that you can view all the code without having to go through time to find out when it was released. It also means that you know a released script is safe to use on here.

We will try and put the following in the top of each script:
	Last official test: <date>
	Release date: <date>
	Release link: <link>

While we love to script and we love others using our work, all the code we have posted is under the rules here: http://nfell2009.uk/no-to-sharing - please read that before doing anything development wise which you may post publicy.

Thanks -nhSkript
